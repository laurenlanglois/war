//war//

This program is a working game of war. Once a name has been assigned to the player, it plays through automatically and declares a winner.

To run this program, you must open it in a python window (originally made with PyCharm) and click "Run"

There are no special modules required. (If you run it with tkinter, it will still work because it is included with Python)

If I had more time, I would have used tkinter to run the game with visuals. (My time was spent elsewhere - on my CS2 project/final)
