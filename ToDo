[] Main Goal: Create war
  War is a game played by two people; in this case, a player and a computer, who begin the game with half of the deck each. 
  Upon each turn, both players will reveal the top card of their deck simultaneously; the higher card of the two wins the round, thus,
  getting the cards that were played in that round. If in a turn, both players reveal the same class of card (ie. two queens), a war
  is established. In a war, players place two cards face down from the top of their deck onto the playing field, the third card they draw
  is to be placed face up and compared. Same rules apply here, higher card wins, if the cards are of the same class, play another war.

  This process is repeated until either a player concedes, or one player holds all of the cards in the deck.

[] Research libraries necessary for the custom visuals I would like to incorporate
[] Create project and plot it out with pseudo code
[] Draw templates for cards, decks, playing field, UI
[] Create and test small build to get a feel for using images in python
[] Make a die and card class
